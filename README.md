DAOs and DeFi are experiencing rapid growth and interest. In the DAO-Fi Fusion hackathon, you get an exciting opportunity to showcase your skills and creativity by building innovative and useful solutions using Sophia Smart Contracts on the æternity blockchain!

Developers from all over the globe are encouraged to contribute to this emerging space and help shape the future of decentralized finance and organizations.

# EMPOWER THE COMMUNITY!

We are looking for **smart individuals** and **teams**, from all over the world, who excel at **functional programming**. Empower the community by creating **tools & frameworks** that allow everybody to easily **create** and **manage DAOs** for decentralized decision making on **æternity** - one of the **most advanced blockchains** in the entire industry!

Your solution should ideally consider **DeFi** aspects (e.g. treasury management) and allow to **enforce decisions** (e.g. payouts) on-chain.

**æternity** was built from scratch and ships its own unique **Virtual Machine (FATE VM)** that executes **Smart Contracts** with almost **zero gas fees**! The Smart Contracts are written in a novel and **functional language** called **Sophia**.

Make yourself familiar with the technology and take this unique opportunity to:

- learn more about **DAOs** & **DeFi**
- have **fun** working together in a **meaningful** challenge that has an **impact** on the whole **ecosystem**
- become a **well-recognized** and **valued** community member
- **improve** your developer skills & become an **expert** in writing **Smart Contracts** in **Sophia**
- win the main prize of **$20,000**!

# Technical Reviews: Feedback from experienced æternity contributors!

Right after the submission deadline has passed and eligible submissons have been determined, selected experienced æternity contributors will perform a technical review and value the project based on specific criteria (see [rules](https://dao-fi-fusion-code-challenge.devpost.com/rules)).

# Community Live Event & Winner Announcement

Once the technical review is finished, the judges will screen and judge the submissions by taking the technical review as well as other criteria (see judging criteria) into consideration. The combined feedback of all judges will determine the 3 main winners.

Every project gets the chance to pitch its solution in the Community Event to the community. This is also the place where in the beginning the 3 main winners will be announced. Be prepared and convince the community to vote for your submission in the Community Award poll!

# Submission Requirements

Build an application that allows users to create and manage DAOs (powered by Sophia Smart Contracts) with their Superhero Wallet at least on æternity testnet (preferably also mainnet) via an user interface.

## Deliverables

- Project name and a list of all team members
- A description of what your project does and why you decided to build it
- Demo video
    - should be around 3 minutes long and include a demo of your working project
    - must be made publicly visible

- Public GitHub code repository which includes:
    - Meaningful README
    - Service(s) and/or application(s) that allow users to create and manage a DAO at least on æternity testnet (preferrably also mainnet) via an user interface by connecting with their Superhero Wallet
    - Instructions how to run the service(s) and/or application(s)
- An URL to the publicly hosted application that allows judges to test during the juding period

# Judging Criteria

## Technical Implementation (40%)
Experienced æternity contributors will perform a technical review on each project. These reviews will be published and considered by judges to pick the winning team. Smart Contracts are a MUST and a high test coverage of these is desired.

## Impact and Usefulness (30%)
Does the project make a significant impact in the æternity ecosystem? How big is the overall market potential of the project?

## User Experience (20%)
How useable is your project? Does it look nice? Does it accomplish what it's set out to do in an easy to use and approachable way?

## Presentation and Communication (10%)
The quality of the project presentation and how well the team communicates the idea. The presentation should be clear, concise, and engaging. Show the community who you are and why your project should win!
